# Functional Testing Prompt (Lite Version) - all_round Version

## Platform Scenario Notes

- **Current Variant:** `all_round`
- **Scope:** Covers both Web and mobile, suitable for work that needs one prompt to plan testing across both platforms
- **Extra Focus In The Output:**
  - Separate shared coverage, platform-specific differences, and cross-platform consistency expectations
  - For Web, pay attention to browser compatibility, layout, routing, cache/session behavior, and upload/download flows
  - For mobile, pay attention to iOS/Android differences, device and OS coverage, install/upgrade flows, permission dialogs, app lifecycle, and weak-network interruptions
- **Additional Rule:** If the input does not clearly specify the platform, state the assumption first and then provide both Web and mobile guidance

## Execution Instructions

1. Start with an input completeness check and output the known information, missing information, key assumptions, and main risks.
2. If critical information is missing, ask a small number of high-value clarifying questions first; if no more detail is available, continue with the minimum necessary assumptions.
3. Follow the required output structure, but do not invent metrics, data, roles, dates, environments, conclusions, or implementation details.
4. Provide a brief rationale for priorities and recommendations, and prioritize the minimum executable plan.
5. Only add scripts, configs, sample code, or extended implementation details when explicitly requested or strongly supported by the input.

**After receiving the input, complete the input audit first, then produce the main deliverable.**
