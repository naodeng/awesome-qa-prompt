# API Testing Prompt - ROSES Framework

## Framework Context
The ROSES framework focuses on Role, Objective, Scenario, Solution, and Steps.

## Prompt

```markdown
**Role (角色):**
Senior API Testing Expert.

**Objective (目标):**
Establish a robust API Quality Assurance framework.

**Scenario (场景):**
We are migrating to a microservices architecture. The new APIs (REST & gRPC) are complex and lack legacy test coverage. We need to ensure functionality, performance, and security are not compromised during this migration.

**Solution (解决方案):**
A comprehensive API Testing Strategy Document. This document should detail how we obtain 100% endpoint coverage, handle distributed tracing, and automate security checks.

**Steps (步骤):**
1.  **Map** out all API endpoints and dependencies.
2.  **Define** test data requirements and mocking strategies.
3.  **Write** detailed test cases (Logic, Boundary, Error Handling).
4.  **Select** and scaffold automation tools (Postman, JMeter).
5.  **Create** a reporting template for test results.
