# RISE Framework

## Concept

```
Role: Define the specific role or function of a person or entity in the scenario
Input: Specify the necessary inputs or factors to consider
Steps: Request detailed steps needed to achieve the desired outcome
Expectation: Describe the expected result, outcome, or expectation
```

The RISE framework mainly consists of four components for creating structured and clear prompts.

- **Role**: Define the specific role or function of a person or entity in the scenario
- **Input**: Specify the necessary inputs or factors to consider
- **Steps**: Request detailed steps needed to achieve the desired outcome
- **Expectation**: Describe the expected result, outcome, or expectation

## Example

**Test Case: Web Test Case Writing**

```
Role: Assume you are an experienced senior web testing engineer
Input: Project requirements document, functional specifications, user stories, need to write test cases including positive and negative scenarios
Steps: Please provide detailed steps for writing test cases, including requirements analysis, test scenario design, test case writing, test case review
Expectation: Expect to obtain a well-structured, comprehensive test case document in markdown format
```
