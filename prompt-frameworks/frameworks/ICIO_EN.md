# ICIO Framework

## Concept

```
Instruction: The specific task to be executed.
Context: Provide background information to guide the model to generate responses that better meet requirements.
Input Data: The data that needs to be processed.
Output Indicator: Inform the type or style of output required.
```

The ICIO framework primarily focuses on task clarity and output format control, particularly suitable for scenarios that require clear guidance for AI to complete specific tasks.

- **Instruction**: Clearly tell the model what needs to be done
- **Context**: Provide contextual environment to guide the model's understanding of the task
- **Input Data**: Provide specific working materials for the model
- **Output Indicator**: Ensure the model's output meets expected format and requirements

## Example

**Test Case: Web Test Case Writing**

```
Instruction: Write test cases for the project
Context: As a senior web testing engineer, need to ensure project quality
Input Data: Project requirements document, functional specifications
Output Indicator: Generated test cases should be in markdown format, including positive and negative scenarios
```

**Prompt**: "Your task is to act as a senior web testing engineer and write test cases for a project. You need to start from the project requirements document and functional specifications to ensure project quality. The generated test cases should be in markdown format, including positive and negative scenarios. First, collect the project requirements, perform requirements analysis, then write test cases."

## Applicable Scenarios

- Tasks requiring precise output format control
- Data processing and transformation tasks
- Scenarios with clear requirements for output style

## Advantages

- Emphasizes task clarity
- Strong output format controllability
- Clear structure, easy to understand
