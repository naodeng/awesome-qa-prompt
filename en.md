## 🎯 Core Features

- **Full Lifecycle Coverage**: Complete testing lifecycle from requirements analysis to test reporting
- **Multi-language Support**: Bilingual prompts in Chinese and English to meet different team needs
- **Full + Lite Versions**: Each testing type provides both full and lite versions for different scenarios
- **Professional**: Each prompt is designed by expert roles with 10+ years of experience
- **Practical**: Provides standardized formats and best practice guidance
- **Extensible**: Modular design for easy extension and customization

> 💡 **Language Switching**: All prompts are available in both Chinese and English. Chinese version files are named `*Prompt.md`, English versions are `*Prompt_EN.md`. Select "Language / 语言" in the navigation bar for quick switching.

## 📈 Project Statistics

- **Testing Type Modules**: 14 (100% complete)
- **Workflows**: 3 (100% complete)
- **Chinese Prompts**: 14 full versions + 14 lite versions
- **English Prompts**: 14 full versions + 14 lite versions
- **Total Documents**: 60+ professional prompt documents

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Select a Prompt
Choose the corresponding prompt file based on your testing task:
- Use Chinese prompts for Chinese projects
- Use English prompts for English projects (_EN.md suffix)
- Use lite versions for quick start (_Lite.md)

### 2. Prepare Input Materials
Prepare the corresponding input documents according to the prompt requirements, for example:
- Requirements analysis requires requirement documents or User Stories
- Test case writing requires test scenarios

### 3. Use AI Assistant
Copy the prompt content to an AI assistant (such as ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor AI, etc.), attach your input materials, and the AI will generate structured test documents.
